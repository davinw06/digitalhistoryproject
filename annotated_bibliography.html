                        In this book, Nigel Bolland analyzes how British colonialism relied on slave labour, controlled land ownership, 
                    and restricted economic development to maintain an extractive system focused on timber exports. He argues that the 
                    British never intended to build long-term infrastructure or diversify the economy, creating deep structural underdevelopment. 
                    This source is valuable for explaining the origins of labour exploitation and institutional neglect.

                        Bulmer-Thomas provides an economic analysis showing that British Honduras remained one of the least developed British 
                    colonies due to its reliance on a single export and lack of British investment.

                        Macaulay explains how the British engineered an extractive economy resistant to diversification and public investment. 
                    He highlights how elites and colonial officials opposed democratic participation or infrastructure expansion. 
                    This supports the argument that Britain had no interest in nation-building.

                        In this book, Shoman explores the total history of Belize, from ancient Mayan Civilization to British rule, and to the 
                    Guatemalan Claim. Shoman argues that Belize’s lack of roads, schools, and diversified industries resulted from deliberate 
                    British policy, set during the period of British rule to ensure that they would have enough land for their own use and purposes. 
                    He details how governance, land laws, and education reinforced dependency, not only on slaves, but also on locals, seeing as 
                    they restrict agriculture for them as well. This would later on be a major detriment to Belize’s development and agricultural growth.

                        The author, Joel Wainwright, did research on the history of colonialism in southern Belize. He mentioned how the British 
                    Colonizer’s exerted their control and influence over the indigenous communities, and that the authority established by the British 
                    did not attend to the needs of the people, but rather to the self-accumulation of resources.

                        Weaver and Sabido indicates, in their document about the history of mahogany. It dates to when Belize still had an environment 
                    rich in logwood, that is, until the British came, where they describe the mahogany resources as being “seriously eroded” by 
                    overcutting. This indicates that the British did not take just a small portion of the mahogany logwood found in Belize, but 
                    enough to the point that mahogany is now a scarce resource in Belize, which not only affects sustainability but also environmental 
                    health as well. The authors also mentioned that colonial policies at the time discouraged local agriculture and development, 
                    leaving agricultural space for only them, and preventing actual development from happening in the country.
