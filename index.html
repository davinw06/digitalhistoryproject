                    <p>By common knowledge, most are aware that the British came to the Americas for exploration, and eventually ended up 
                        exploiting the land for its resources, bringing slaves with them to accomplish this task. Focusing on Belize, which housed British 
                        colonizers exporting mahogany wood back to Britain after slaves shopped them down. While they were here, they set up only small camps, 
                        not meant to last, to work from. This indicates that the British did not intend to actually build on this land or improve its economy 
                        in any way. Due to this, it was left at the hands of the Belizeans that migrated here at the time from neighbouring lands, and the 
                        previously enslaved Afri-Belizeans to build the infrastructure and the economy of Belize Honduras.

                <p>The above images show a depiction of how the cruelty that the slaves were treated with by the British slave owners. They show
                    children being taken away from mothers, and workers being whipped. Showcasing just how cruelly the slaves were treated while they were here 
                    working for the British, and during their transit here.
