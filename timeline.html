                <h4>1638 – Arrival of British logwood cutters</h4>
                <p>This marks the beginning of British settlement and extraction economy, prioritizing extraction over development. With the British 
                    rule rarely offering assistance in development, Belize would soon be left with little infrastructure. 
                    <br><br>
                    During this period they would set up camps, and scout the forests for mahogany and other useful resources such as chicle. Overall, 
                    this would improve British economy at the expense of Belize's environment and its resources.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="event-text" id="e2">
                <h4>1720s – Mahogany expansion</h4>
                <p>Early forestry regulations and trade restrictions were put in place, favoring British merchants, limiting local agriculture and development. 
                    To achieve this, they would have to exert their influence over the indigenous communities existing in Belize. 
                    <br><br>
                    This would allow them to further expand the scouting area for mahogany wood, while leaving the local communities without land for 
                    agriculture.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="event-text" id="e3">
                <h4>Late 1700s-1800s - British Crown formalizes control</h4>
                <p>This marks the period where development and agricultural restricting policies entrenched Belize with social and economic inequality, 
                    officially limiting local development and access to resources, leaving local communities subject to stagnation 
                    by the British rule.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="event-text" id="e4">
                <h4>1838 – Emancipation</h4>
                <p>A period where moral backlash led to the legal emancipation of slaves. However, slavery continued in Belize and slaves were still required 
                    to work under their British masters to continue the extraction of logwood.
                    <br><br>This means that Belize would be further subjugated to the exploitation of its resources, further impacting the 
                    health of Belize's environment.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="event-text" id="e5">
                <h4>1862 - British Honduras declared a Crown Colony</h4>
                <p>During this period British Honduras was officially declared a Crown Colony, meaning that the British now had all rights to be there and export
                    mahogany logwood and all the other resources they had accumulated at this point.
                    <br><br>
                    The British Crown appoints a Governor General to the British Honduras colony, expanding control over the settlement and reinforces 
                    oppressive policies put in place previously. They would also control land ownership, all for the purpose of greater exports to Britain. 
                    These legal frameworks only work to further expand British economy, not Belize's economy.
                </p>

            <div class="event-text" id="e6">
                <h4>Late 1800s – Peak mahogany exports</h4>
                <p>As a result of the official declaration of British Honduras as a Crown Colongy, mahogany exports increased, further depleting Belize's reservoir of natural 
                    resources. 
                    <br><br>
                    Resource extraction was also structured to further benefit Britain; limited reinvestment in local infrastructure or diversified economy.
